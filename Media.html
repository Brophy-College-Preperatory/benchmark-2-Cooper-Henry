    <h1>Media and how it represents Nuclear Fusion</h1>
    <p>Nuclear Fusion has been around for a while, and with it has come a variety of questions</p>
    <p>This section will try to answer some of the most common questions about nuclear fusion</p>
    <h2>Why is nuclear fusion taking so long?</h2>
    <p>Nuclear fusion is a very complicated subject. Even after several decades of research, attempts, and materials, it is still a completly new topic to us. We have been making more advancesments, and it is seeming more likly, but it will still take time</p>
    <h2>If people can do nuclear fusion at home, why isn't it viable?</h2>
    <p>Not only is the nuclear fusion done very simple and not at all to scale "nuclear fusion," but nuclear fusion is able to be done. It is just how we arn't about to get a positve energy output, meaning we get more energy then we put in</p>
    <h2>Why is there a "nulcear fusion material shortage?</h2>
    <p>Hellium 3 and Trillium are both very rare materials. Why nuclear fusion is able to switch to dueterium, which is commonly found in seawater, hellium 3 is still needed and is still just as rare. It is theroized that the moon could have a lot of hellium 3, but that is still a theory. We are still able to preform nuclear fusion today, but we do need to find those materials soon</p>
