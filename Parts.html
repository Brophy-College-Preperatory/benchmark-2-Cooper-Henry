    <h1>The Parts in Nuclear Fusion</h1>
    <p>First, a General Explination about how Nuclear Fusion is done generally.</p>
    <p>Nuclear Fusion is the process of pushing two atoms together, which creates a larger atom.</p>
    <p>This process releases a large amount of energy, while using very little mass.</p>
    <p>However, the process of pushing these atoms together can be done in a variety of ways, with there being three main methods.</p>
    <p>There are many different methods beyond just these three, but these three are the main ones. And each of these different methods require vastly different parts, actions, and tools.</p>
    <p>However, they all do share one thing in common; the matierals.</p>
    <p>All nuclear fusion requires the use of hydrogen and hellium, plasma, and something that creates heat, which is what creates the energy.</p>

 <h1>The Three Types of Nuclear Fusion</h1>
<div class="box">
   <div style="background-color:#FFF4A3;">
      <h2>Gravitational Confinement</h2>
      <img src="assets/sun.png">
      <p>Only Possible on the Sun or other areas in the universe with high enough gravity</p>
      <br>
      <p>Uses Gravitational Forces to push atoms together, which creates the heat</p>
      <br>
      <p>The very method used to create universes, as that is pushing atoms together into one mass</p>
      <br>
      <p>Too little space of gravitational confinement to preform this method</p>
      <br>
   </div>

   <div style="background-color:#FFC0C7;">
      <h2>Magnetic Confinement</h2>
      <img src="assets/MC.png">
      <p>Heat up a circle of plasma until it is hot enough to fuse. Has to keep a steady and confined space</p>
      <p>Attempts to copy to what the sun does, but at a much more managable and smaller scale</p>
      <h3>Parts:</h3>
      <p>Tokamak (the large cylinder) in the center that contains magnets</p>
      <p>Magnetic Field</p>
      <p>Electrical Current</p>
      <p>Plasma Current</p>
      <br>
   </div>

   <div style="background-color:#D9EEE1;">
      <h2>Inertial Confinement</h2>
      <img src="assets/IC.png">
      <p>Compresses the plasma using lasers in nearly one billionth of a second, which makes the plasma hot enough to fuse and release energy</p>
      <p>Much different method compared to what the Sun normally does</p>
      <h3>Parts:</h3>
      <p>Hohlraum (The piece that holds the plasma)</p>
      <p>Inferread Laser</p>
      <p>X-Rays</p>
      <p>Ultraviolat Laser</p>
