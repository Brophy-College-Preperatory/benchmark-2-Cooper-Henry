    <h1>The History of Nuclear Fusion</h1>
    <p>Nuclear Fusion has been around for a good few decades at this point, and each passing decade has included advancements, challenges, and even doubts</p>
    <p>1920-1930: Rutherford and figured out about the combination of hellium 3 and tritium equals a massive amount of energy being released</p>
    <p>1950s: Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm proposed the idea of a magnetic confinement fusion device (tokamak)</p>
    <p>1970-1980: This was when science realized how difficult this would be and when The construction of JET started</p>
    <p>1980-2000s: JET continues to prefomr nuclear fusion, set a couple of world records, and made advancements in nuclear fusion</p>
    <p>2000-present: IETR members continue to advance nuclear fusion, gets more and more energy output from nuclear fusion, and now we are continuing to make nuclear fusion more energy vialbe</p>
