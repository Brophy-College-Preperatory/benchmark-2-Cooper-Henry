    <h1>Nuclear Fusion</h1>

 </body>

 <p>Nuclear Fusion is a concpet that we have spent many decacdes trying to perfect and be made commercially viable, even if it still isn't viable today</p>
 <p>There was one source that we know preforms nuclear fusion, and that is the Sun. We have tried to replicate that process and have tried out new methods</p>
 <p>This website will go over nearly everything with nuclear fusion, with the parts, how it works, the timeline, and even answer common questions about nuclear fusion</p>
 <p>While we still might not have achieved nuclear fusion today, hopefully today, I can convince you to consider nuclear fusion as a sustainable, reliable, and effective energy source</p>
